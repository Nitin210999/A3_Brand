    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Carefully Inspected Vehicles 
  
  
  
    </h3>
  
    <p>
      Acura Precision Used Vehicles are meticulously inspected to ensure that they meet the high standards of quality and reliability that customers expect from the Acura brand. The inspection process starts with a comprehensive 112-point inspection (180-point for Acura Precision Certified Pre-Owned cars) that covers many aspects of the vehicle, from the engine and transmission to the interior and exterior. This inspection is conducted by Acura-trained technicians who have extensive knowledge of the brand's engineering and design standards. 
  
  
  
  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      During the inspection, the technicians use specialized diagnostic equipment to check for any issues with the vehicle's mechanical systems. They also inspect the body and exterior for any signs of wear and tear, as well as the interior for any damage or issues with the electronics and other features. Once the inspection is complete, the technicians make any necessary repairs or replacements using only genuine Acura parts. 
  
   
  
  
  
    </p>
    <p>
      The rigorous inspection process and warranty coverage ensure that every car in Acura's Certified Pre-Owned catalog (aka Acura CPO inventory) is among the highest quality and most reliable used cars on the market. So even if you check the vehicle's history report, you can rest assured that it was properly taken care of. 
    </p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>Concierge Service: This includes urgent message relay, emergency airline reservations & ticketing assistance, 24-hour weather information, arrangement for the emergency shipment of personal items, and more.

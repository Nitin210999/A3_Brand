    <h2 class="font-weight-bold">2023 Acura MDX vs. 2023 Lexus LX
  
  
  
   
    </h2>
  
    <p>
      If you're in the market for a new crossover, you've probably considered Lexus and Acura models. They are two of the most prominent SUV makers in the market today, and there's a lot to consider between them. 
   
  
  
  
  
   
  
    </p>
    <p>
      Both are popular choices for luxury-minded drivers who want a reliable SUV with plenty of space and power under the hood. But which one is right for you? 
   
  
   
  
  
  
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's match up the 2023 Acura MDX versus the 2023 Lexus LX so you can learn the pros and cons of each model and decide which is best for your needs! 
  
  
    </p>
   
  
  
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Pricing 
   
  
  
    </h3>
  
    <p>
      The Acura MDX's suggested retail price starts at $49,550, while the Lexus LX has a base price of $90,660. Both cars come with a four-year 50,000-mile basic warranty and a six-year 70,000-mile powertrain warranty. The MDX belongs to the midsize luxury SUV category, while the Lexus LX is in the large class of luxury SUVs. 
    </p>
  
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Interior Design 
   
  
  
  
    </h3>
  
    <p>
      The interior of the 2023 MDX has a premium feel, with materials that make it look and feel like a top-tier luxury SUV. The MDX's open-pore wood accents and handcrafted leather dash are details that underscore its premium feel. This high-end SUV boasts three rows of well-appointed seating in a spacious cabin—the perfect option for families who want to travel in style. 
  
  
  
  
  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The interior of the Lexus LX is luxurious, with high-quality materials and fine detailing. The base model includes leather upholstery and open-grain wood accents, and upgraded interiors include semi-aniline or quilted leather seats. Takanoha wood accents are also available but in the Luxury trims only. 
   
  
   
  
  
  
    </p>
   
  
  
  
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Exterior Design 
  
  
  
  
    </h3>
  
    <p>
      When it comes to exterior design, the 2022 Acura MDX has luxury written all over its build quality. The sleek, streamlined design of this midsize SUV has a sporty feel to it. You can modify your MDX even further by adding an available trailer hitch and roof rails if you want to take advantage of its towing capacity! 
  
  
  </p>
  
    <p>
      On the other hand, the 2023 Lexus LX refresh added a new front facia and grille, new rear tail lights, a light bar, and an updated version of its signature spindle grille with an L-shaped pattern at its center. 
  
  
  
  
  
    </p>
  
   
  
  
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Gas Mileage 
  
   
   
    </h3>
  
  
    <p>
      In terms of fuel efficiency, both vehicles are about the same. The MDX has a slight edge in city driving with a 19 mpg rating compared to 17 mpg for its Lexus counterpart. Even on the highway, MDX's fuel economy is still better than the LX, where both cars get 26 and 22 mpg, respectively. 
  
  
  </p>
    
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Seating and Cargo Space 
   
   
    </h3>
    <p>The MDX has a seating capacity of up to seven people across three rows. Synthetic leather upholstery, heated and 12-way power-adjustable seats, and a removable second-row middle seat come standard. 
  
  
    </p>
    <p>Milano leather upholstery, 16-way power-adjustable front seats, heated second-row outboard seats, a heated steering wheel, and heated/ventilated front seats are also available on the Acura MDX for higher trims. 
  
   
    </p>
    <p>On the other corner, the base LX seats up to five people in two rows. All other trims seat seven except for the Ultra Luxury trim, which has four. Leather upholstery is standard on all models. 
  
  
    </p>
    <p>Regarding cargo volume, both vehicles are almost equal in capacity. Still, the MDX has a bit of an edge with a maximum capacity of 71.4 cubic feet, while the LX has an overall cargo capacity of 71 cubic feet. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Performance 
    </h3>
    <p>The Acura MDX has a 290 HP V-6 mated to a quick-shifting 10-speed automatic transmission that delivers aggressive power and acceleration for nearly all driving situations. With up to 5,000 lbs. of towing, the 2023 MDX ambitiously takes on any adventure, handles confidently, and delivers accurate steering when rounding corners. 
   
  
    </p>
    <p>Though the Lexus is a heavy vehicle, its light steering makes it easy to maneuver in traffic and into parking spots. Unfortunately, the Lexus LX's body roll is not kept in check, and it tends to get wobbly over bumps — this can make for uncomfortable rides at times. While the overall ride quality on the LX is comfortable, you may still feel somewhat unbalanced at high speeds or over large bumps. 
  
  
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Technology </h3>
    <p>The LX's infotainment system is state-of-the-art, but you may have to spend some time getting used to it. The main 12.3-inch touchscreen has crisp graphics and responsive menus — but some critics say it's hard to reach. 
    </p>
    <p>The MDX is equipped with a wide range of standard convenience features. It has a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, a 12.3-inch infotainment display, a touchpad controller, wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, Amazon Alexa, a Wi-Fi hot spot, wireless device charging, and satellite radio. Other standard features include tri-zone automatic climate control and proximity keyless entry. 
    </p>
  
  
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Safety  </h3>
    <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has awarded the 2023 Acura MDX an overall safety rating of five out of five stars. The crossover received a perfect score in side crash tests and four-star ratings for its performance on frontal and rollover exams. 
    </p>
    <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has not crash-tested the new 2023 MDX, but it did evaluate the previous version, the 2022 MDX, and bestowed upon it its highest safety rating — a Top Safety Pick+ award. 
    </p>
    <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have not crash-tested the 2023 Lexus LX. 
    </p>
  
  
  
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Takeaway  </h3>
    <p>In this battle of top luxury SUV makers, Acura vs. Lexus, we learn the best parts of the Lexus LX and the Acura MDX. 
    </p>
    <p>The Lexus LX is a luxury SUV that offers an attractive ride, plenty of passenger space, and cargo capacity. Its exterior design is appealing. However, the vehicle has a high price tag. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, the 2023 Acura MDX is an overall better SUV for most people because it offers more comfort, safety, and technology at a more affordable price. It also has a more modern interior design than the 2023 Lexus LX and better safety features. Additionally, the MDX has two-row and three-row models, so it's a better choice for families who need extra space for children and pets.

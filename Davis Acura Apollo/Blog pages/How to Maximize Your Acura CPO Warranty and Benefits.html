<h2 class="font-weight-bold">How to Maximize Your Acura CPO Warranty and Benefits</h2>
<p>When maximizing your Acura Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) warranty and benefits, it is important that you understand what is covered under your warranty. Knowing what is covered will also help you make smart decisions in case of emergency or roadside incidents. Additionally, being aware of the duration of the warranty will help you plan for any necessary repairs or maintenance in the future.</p>
<p>Acura offers two distinct programs, namely the Acura Precision Certified and Precision Used programs, that provide extensive coverage and benefits to ensure that you are well taken care of throughout your ownership experience.</p>
<p>Beyond the comprehensive Acura warranty coverages, an Acura Certified Preowned vehicle offers several other significant benefits such as Emergency Roadside Assistance and Towing, Trip-Interruption Expense Reimbursement, Concierge Service, and Complimentary Service, which we will all discuss in this article.</p>








<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Acura CPO Warranty Programs</h3>
<p>The Acura Precision Certified program covers Acura vehicles that are six years old or newer with fewer than 80,000 miles at delivery time. This program provides non-powertrain coverage for two years or 100,000 total odometer miles, based on whichever occurs first. This coverage can begin from the date of sale of the Acura Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle if the New Vehicle Limited Warranty has expired or after the expiration of the original New Vehicle Limited Warranty up to 6 years/100,000 total odometer miles from the original in-service date. Meanwhile, the original in-service date grants powertrain coverage for seven years or 100,000 total odometer miles.</p>
<p>For the Precision Used program, the Acura model must be ten years old from its original in-service date at the time of sale. The Precision Used Warranty provides coverage for both powertrain and non-powertrain for up to 6 months or 7,500 miles, beginning at the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or from the date of sale of the Acura Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle if the New Vehicle Limited Warranty has expired at the time of sale.</p>
<p>Both programs ensure that repairs are conducted using the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) for original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts and Acura factory flat rate labor time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each Acura CPO vehicle undergoes rigorous inspection and reconditioning to meet high Acura standards. This inspection covers every aspect of the vehicle, from mechanical systems to the body condition and appearance. If any components don't meet Acura's strict requirements, they are repaired or replaced before the vehicle is offered for sale. This process helps ensure you get a like-new vehicle thoroughly checked and tested to deliver optimal performance and reliability.</p>














<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Acura CPO Benefits</h3>
<p>Your Acura Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle is eligible for services provided by Acura Care® Motor Club Partner at no additional cost. Acura Precision Certified vehicles are also eligible for services during the Acura Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles Non-Powertrain Coverage period. Additionally, Acura Precision Used vehicles will be eligible for services for one year or 12,000 miles starting from the New Vehicle Limited Warranty expiration or the date the customer takes delivery of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty has already expired.</p>








<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Emergency Roadside Assistance and Towing</h3>
<p>When unexpected situations arise on the road, certified preowned Acura owners can rest assured knowing that they have access to comprehensive Emergency Roadside Assistance and Towing services. Whether it's a mechanical breakdown or a vehicle accident/collision, if the need arises, emergency towing to the nearest authorized Acura dealership or repair facility is provided.</p>
<p>Acura's Emergency Roadside Assistance also includes services to address common roadside issues. These services include flat tire changes (utilizing the spare tire), battery boosts (jump-starts), emergency fuel delivery (up to 3 gallons), lockout assistance, and winch service within 10 feet of a paved road. With Acura's commitment to ensuring your peace of mind on the road, their Emergency Roadside Assistance and Towing program provides prompt and reliable assistance whenever you need it most.</p>









<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Trip-Interruption Expense Reimbursement</h3>
<p>Suppose a mechanical breakdown disables your vehicle overnight more than 100 miles from your residence. In that case, Acura Care® Motor Club Partner will reimburse you for receipted expenses incurred for alternate transportation, food, and accommodations for the first three consecutive days while the vehicle is being repaired.</p>





<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Concierge Service</h3>
<p>The Concierge Service is a testament to Acura's commitment to exceptional customer service, enhancing convenience and security for vehicle owners. It offers urgent message relay, emergency cash advance, travel-related assistance, insurance support, auto-glass replacement referrals, and emergency shipments of personal items.</p>








<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Complimentary Service</h3>
<p>With the Precision Certified program, you receive the assurance of a quality pre-owned vehicle and enjoy additional benefits that enhance your ownership experience. One such benefit is the included maintenance plan. Acura provides you with a complimentary maintenance visit for the first 12 months or 12,000 miles (whichever comes first) from the date of vehicle delivery. This visit is determined by your vehicle's Maintenance Minder™ system, ensuring that you receive the necessary maintenance services specific to your vehicle's needs. The maintenance visit may include services such as oil and filter changes, tire rotations, air intake filter replacements, cabin air filter replacements, rear differential fluid checks (if applicable), and brake fluid inspections.</p>
<p>While the Acura Precision Used program offers a complimentary oil change, this valuable benefit is available for 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first, at no additional cost. It's just another way that Acura goes above and beyond to make your ownership experience exceptional. So sit back and relax, knowing that your vehicle is in good hands and that Acura is committed to providing unparalleled service and support every step of the way.</p>






<h3 class="font-weight-bold">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>In summary, understanding and maximizing your Acura Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) warranty and benefits is vital for a hassle-free ownership experience. By familiarizing yourself with the coverage provided by your warranty, you can make wise choices in unexpected situations on the road. Moreover, knowing the duration of your warranty enables you to effectively plan for any future maintenance or repair needs.</p>

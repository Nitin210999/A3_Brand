        advanced features, such as Multi-link Air Suspension, High-Performance Adaptive Damper, Brembo front brakes, and
        22-inch aluminum alloy wheels, contribute to its exceptional handling and responsiveness. Acura also offers a
        choice between all-season and summer tires, allowing drivers to optimize their ZDX Type S performance based on
        their driving preferences.


    </p>

    <p>Additionally, Acura's claim of achieving 0-60 in under 5 seconds, as per internal testing, further solidifies the

        enhancing the vehicle's overall stability and handling.


    </p>
    <p>The Acura ZDX 2024 is expected to receive an EPA range rating of 325 zero-emission miles in the A-Spec
        single-motor configuration, demonstrating a commitment to practicality and sustainability. This impressive range

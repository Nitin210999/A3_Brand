    <p>On March 27, 1986, Acura made its grand entrance into the automotive world with the launch of the
        first-generation Integra. Available as both a three and five-door hatchback, this sporty compact car was an
        instant hit with car enthusiasts looking for a thrilling driving experience. With a 1.6-liter DOHC 4-cylinder
        engine and a 5-speed manual transmission, the Integra quickly gained a reputation as one of the finest-driving
        front-wheel-drive sport compacts money could buy.</p>
    <p>The following year, the Acura Integra set a new benchmark for performance when the Comptech-tuned model won the
        IMSA International Sedan series. This was the first of many championship wins for the Integra, solidifying its

        comfort and performance. Further improving upon the legacy of the Integra, the GS-R with VTEC was available in a
        sedan for the first time.</p>
    <p>In 1997, Acura introduced the Integra Type R to the US market, stunning car enthusiasts with its hand-built

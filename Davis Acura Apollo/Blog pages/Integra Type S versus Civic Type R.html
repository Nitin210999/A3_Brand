    <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Integra Type S Versus Civic Type R</h2>

    <p>
        In 1997, the Integra Type R debuted and remained available until 2001,
        marking the conclusion of the third-generation Integra chassis. The RSX Type
        S took its place following its departure, offering a more subdued demeanor.
        On the flip side, the Civic Type R was noticeably absent from the U.S.
        market until 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a 21-year hiatus, the legend has returned. Today, the mightiest
        Integra becomes the Type S redesigned for the modern driving enthusiast; the
        fifth-generation Acura Integra is a technological showcase that combines the
        same passionate performance of its predecessors with seamless connectivity
        and dynamic styling exceeding its Honda counterpart, Civic Type R.
    </p>
    <p>
        The company ensures that the
        <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/acura/integra">2024 Acura Integra Type S</a>
        will maintain its bragging rights over its 2023
        <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/honda/civic-type-r">Civic Type R sibling</a>
        by giving it an edge in horsepower. The turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four
        will make 320 hp, five hp more than the Civic Type R. When it comes to
        performance, the Integra Type S takes the lead and surpasses its counterpart
        in many areas. Notably, it boasts remarkable advancements in both its
        exterior and interior features, making it a standout choice.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>Starting with the engines, while the 2024 Lexus TX impresses with its 2.4-liter turbo engine producing 275
      horsepower and 317 lb.-ft. of torque, the 2024 Acura MDX showcases its prowess with a standard 3.5-liter V-6
      engine churning out 290 horsepower and 267 lb.-ft. of torque. This initial comparison already positions the
      Acura MDX as a formidable competitor in terms of raw power.</p>
  
  <p>What truly sets the Acura MDX apart, however, is its exclusive engine option available in the Type S and Type S
      Advance trims. With a potent 3.0-liter twin-scroll turbocharged V-6 engine delivering an impressive 355
      horsepower and 354 lb.-ft. of torque, the MDX elevates the driving experience to exhilarating heights that the
      Lexus TX simply cannot match.</p>
  
  <p>Transmission-wise, the Acura MDX once again takes the lead with its 10-speed automatic transmission, offering
      smoother shifts and enhanced performance compared to the 8-speed automatic transmission found in the Lexus TX.
  </p>
  
  <p>When it comes to drivetrain, both vehicles offer all-wheel drive capabilities, but the Acura MDX&#39;s Super
      Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system provides precision control by distributing power to all four wheels.
      This feature not only enhances traction and stability but also grants the MDX an impressive maximum towing
      capacity of up to 5000 lbs. and makes it even more fun to drive.</p>
  
  <p>In terms of handling and maneuverability, the Acura MDX once again excels with its variable ratio steering and
      tuned electric power steering booster, ensuring precise control and agile handling that elevate the driving
      experience to new heights.</p>
  
  <p>Lastly, the Acura MDX&#39;s ultra-rigid chassis and longer wheelbase work in harmony to deliver a supremely
      comfortable ride, reducing vibration and ambient noise while enhancing handling response and overall
      performance. So, if you are looking for the best luxury SUV driving experience, look no further than the 2024
      Acura MDX for sale at Davis Acura.</p>-->

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Powertrain</h3>

    <p>
        The latest 2024 Acura Integra Type S features a turbocharged DOHC 2.0-liter
        four-cylinder K20C1 engine and a six-speed manual gearbox. The 2.0-liter
        turbocharged four-cylinder engine generates 320 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and
        delivers 310 pound-feet of torque, accessible between 2,600 and 4,000 rpm.
        While 2023 Honda Civic Type S has 315 horsepower, making it less
        advantageous when it comes to this aspect. Acura stated that the Type S
        sound is distinct for each driving mode and, in Sport Mode, includes "pops
        and bangs."
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the Integra Type S shares some of the most remarkable features
        of the Civic Type R, such as the Dual-Axis front suspension and Adaptive
        Damper System, providing steady handling and addressing torque steer-related
        initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The car has wider NSX Type S-inspired wheels, giving it a distinctive,
        sporty, and confident look. The front and rear are fitted with 265/30
        Michelin Pilot Sport 4S summer tires, providing excellent grip on the road.
        With a wide track and an extended wheelbase of 2.8 inches, the Integra Type
        S features upgraded performance features to ensure a smooth driving
        experience on sharp bends and at high speeds.
    </p>

    <!--  <p>Acura goes beyond pure horsepower to elevate the driving experience. Features like paddle shifters for manual gear changes and standard Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) add to the RDX's sporty character. Meanwhile, the QX50's continuously variable transmission (CVT) can feel less engaging than the RDX's 10-speed automatic transmission, particularly for enthusiasts seeking a dynamic driving experience.
  .</p>
  
  <p>While both the 2024 Infiniti QX50 and 2024 Acura RDX are compelling choices, the RDX's sharper powertrain, superior handling, exceptional build quality, and driver-focused features solidify its position as the true contender for the title of best sport crossover. For those seeking an exhilarating and dynamic driving experience in a luxurious and versatile package, the Acura RDX stands out as the clear choice.
  </p>-->

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Exterior</h3>

    <p>
        Regarding looks, the Acura Integra Type S takes a more sophisticated and
        mature approach compared to Honda Civic Type R. Unlike the Type R, the Type
        S doesn't feature a towering rear wing. Instead, it opts for a milder
        decklid spoiler that blends in with its overall design. Moving down to the
        rear end, the Type S showcases a purposeful appearance with a well-defined
        diffuser surrounding three exhaust finishers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Integra Type S accentuates its bulging fenders. Significant enhancements
        have been made to the vehicle's front end, extending from the A-pillars and
        onwards, to create a more refined and polished look, further enhancing the
        vehicle's overall appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Integra Type S features an aluminum hood with vents above Acura's
        distinctive diamond pentagon grille. This combination significantly enhances
        airflow, leading to a remarkable 170 percent improvement in cooling for the
        2.0-liter engine. As a result, users can expect better performance and
        reduced overheating concerns during track days, especially compared to the
        previous generation Type R.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of color options, Integra Type S offers seven color choices, a
        range of deep, rich monochromatic premium paint colors, including
        Performance Red Pearl, Liquid Carbon Metallic, Majestic Black Pearl,
        Platinum White Pearl, Apex Blue Pearl, and the Type S exclusive Tiger Eye
        Pearl are available for drivers who demand a rich finish. However, Civic
        Type R buyers have a limited selection with just five paint choices,
        including Crystal Black Pearl, Rallye Red, Boost Blue Pearl, Sonic Gray
        Pearl, and Championship White.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, if you prefer a car with a more refined and understated aesthetic,
        the Integra Type S is a better choice over the Civic Type R.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>To add a final touch, the Acura RDX 2024 offers premium paint options, including Performance Red Pearl, Liquid Carbon Metallic, Majestic Black Pearl, Platinum White Pearl, Phantom Violet Pearl, and Apex Blue Pearl. These high-quality pigments, applied in a series of tinted clear coats, result in a brilliant chromatic color with a deep, rich finish, elevating the Acura RDX's exterior aesthetics.
  </p>
  
  <p>The 2024 Acura RDX outshines the 2024 Infiniti QX50 in design, providing a more luxurious interior, superior cargo space, advanced features, and an aggressive yet sophisticated exterior.
  </p>-->

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Interior</h3>

    <p>
        The Integra Type S has a more sophisticated interior with sporty leather
        seats, suede inserts, and heating. Leather upholstery covers various car
        sections, including the steering wheel, dash, and door panels. Aluminum trim
        pieces are also present throughout the interior. Essentially, the Integra
        Type S is a more refined version of the Civic Type R. Including these
        premium elements makes the Integra Type S more reasonable than Civic Type R.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Acura Integra features a 10.2-inch Driver Information Interface (digital
        gauge cluster) and a 9.0-inch touchscreen infotainment unit, providing the
        convenience and connectivity you expect from a modern vehicle. Integra sets
        itself apart with a different approach to the dashboard design. Unlike the
        Civic's honeycomb vented dash treatment, the Acura Integra adopts a more
        conventional left, center, and right air vent setup. This design choice
        enhances the overall functionality and practicality of the dashboard.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Integra gets a boost in audio to the tune of a 16-speaker, ELS STUDIO 3D
        premium audio system backed by 530 watts, compared to the 12-speaker Bose
        setup in the Civic. Also, the materials used throughout the Type S appear
        more upscale in comparison, and the switches appear slightly different.
    </p>
    <!--<p>In comparison, the 2024 Lexus TX offers Lexus Safety System+ 3.0, a suite of standard active safety and
      convenience features. However, with only six safety features compared to the MDX&#39;s 9, the Lexus TX falls
      short in terms of offering a comprehensive safety package.</p>
  
  <p>For those seeking the best luxury SUV with advanced safety features, the 2024 Acura MDX for sale at Davis Acura
      stands out as the superior choice.</p>-->

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Verdict</h3>

    <p>
        The Acura Integra Type S has returned after a 21-year hiatus. It offers
        impressive performance, exceeding its counterpart, the Honda Civic Type R,
        in horsepower. Its upgraded features, such as the turbocharged engine and
        improved handling, deliver a thrilling driving experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The exterior design of the Integra Type S is more sophisticated and mature,
        without the towering rear wing seen on the Civic Type R. The interior is
        refined with luxurious leather seats and premium materials, along with
        advanced technology features for convenience and connectivity. The Acura
        Integra Type S offers a more elegant and understated option than the Honda
        Civic Type R.
